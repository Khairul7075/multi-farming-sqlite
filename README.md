# ðŸŒ¾ Multi-Farming SQLite

**Multi-Farming SQLite** is a relational database system designed to support integrated farming practicesâ€”where multiple crops and animals are cultivated together in the same field and season. Examples include growing paddy with fish or corn (*bhutta*) with ducks (*hans*). This project helps farmers and researchers plan, track, and optimize multi-farming strategies using SQLite.
